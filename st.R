## let's do some statistics hahah

## our hypothesis : is power consumption similar all year?
### this means we have to do annova cause we have multiple group need to compare means across it.
#### steps to do that 
# null hypothesis h0 : meanse consumption is the same for all year
# alternative hypothesis h1: means at leat one year is different mean consumption 
# interpretion : if p-value <0.05 ,reject h0 (evidence of differences)

## to know significant differance we have to do tukey hsd(honeslty significant differance) : do when comparisions by pair in that case it is ideal
## there is other method like bonferroni part of corelation overall we find significant differance do when you compair any set
hsd<-TukeyHSD(annova_test)

## datable()## data frame to show how the each year have significant differance or by oberserving p-value we decide power consumption same in all year

df_hsd<-as.data.frame(hsd$`factor(year)`)

df_hsd$significant<- ifelse(df_hsd$`p adj` < 0.05, "Different","Similar")

## extract similar year consumption or not similar year consumption

## alernatily different year
diff_pairs<-df_hsd[df_hsd$significant=="Different",]

# Export to csv
write.csv(similar_pairs,"similar_year.csv")
write.csv(diff_pairs,"Different_year.csv")

df4=read.csv("Different_year.csv")
df4$X


## another hypothesis: is there is relationship b/w consumption and renewable source (Wind,Solar,wind+solor)?
## this is about corelation and relationship 
## there is two way find correlation strenth of linear relationship 
## other is linear regression it tell how much it fit 
## we go with linear regression

### null hypothesis No linear relationship between consumption and renewables.
### alternative hypothesis at leat one predictor has significant effect
### it takes to interpretion (compare p-value)
colnames(df3)
model<-lm(Consumption ~ Wind+Solar,data = df3)
summary(model)

## p-value is smaller show that both predictors are statically significant

##________________________________________________________________________________________
### do one more hypothesis
## is Consumption Different Between Seasons?
## If you want to compare consumption across seasons (e.g., winter vs. summer)
## like it has group winter and summer need to annova test


#steps
#Create a season column (e.g., winter, spring, summer, fall).
#Run ANOVA or t-tests to compare means.

get_season <- function(month) {
  season <- ifelse(month %in% c(12, 1, 2), "Winter",

                          ifelse(month %in% c(6, 7, 8), "Summer",
                                 ifelse(month %in% c(9, 10, 11), "Autumn", NA))))

model_updated<-lm(Consumption ~Wind+Solar,data = df3)
summary(model_updated)

## summary
# we got small pvalue less than 0.05 , we conclude the relationship is there 

# Intercept (1333.33): When both Wind and Solar are zero, 
# average consumption would be about 1333 units. This is the baseline demand level.

# Statistical Significance: Both Wind and Solar have very low p-values,
# meaning we are highly confident that these predictors affect consumption.

# F-statistic (64.97, p < 2.2e-16): The overall regression model is statistically significant. 
# At least one predictor (Wind or Solar) contributes meaningfully to explaining variation in Consumption.

# Model Fit (RÂ² = 0.0288): Only about 2.9% of the variation in consumption is explained by Wind and Solar together.
# This means other factors (not included in the model) are driving the majority of variation in energy consumption.
